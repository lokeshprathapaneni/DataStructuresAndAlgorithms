1)What is the time complexity of the following code snippet

for(int i = 1 ; i <= n ; i+=2){

print(i);

}

A)O(N)

Explanation:

Since we are now incrementing “i” at a faster rate we know that we will reach the end of the loop a bit faster. 
For example if “n” was 4, in the loop where we increment by 1 we will execute 4 times and in the loop where we increment by 2 we will execute only 2 times.
So looking at the example our time complexity should be O(n/2) but n can be so big that even if we divide it by 2 our algorithm will still take n 
units of time. Therefore, whenever any constant is either added/subtracted or multiplied/divided from the n we prefer to just consider it as O(n)

2)for (i = 1; i < n; i=i*2){
    statement # Some logic that the algorithm is performing.
}

A)LogN base 2

Explanation: Here the loop counter “i” is being multiplied by 2 every time the loop executes until “i” exceeds the value of n. 
Since it is being multiplied by 2 it is increasing at a much faster rate than if it was added by 2. To clearly understand this let’s calculate each value of i in the loop above.

Number of loops:   i:
1                  2
2                  2*2 or 2^2
3                  2^3
4                  2^4
.                   .
.                   .
.                   .
k                  2^k
So here when the loop runs k times i will have the value of 2^k. 
Since the loop is running k times we know at the last loop the value of i was equal to n which cause the loop to break.
We know that the value of i at the kth run was 2^k, so when the loop broke at i= n we can also say that 2^k = n
Since k is the number of times the loop runs we need to find k to get the time complexity. We know that 2^k = n, now if we take log base 2 on either sides we get k = log2(n). 
So we can now say that the loop runs log2(n) times.

for (i = n; i < 1; i=i/2){
    statement # Some logic that the algorithm is performing.
}


A)O(log(N) base 2)

for (i = n; i < 1; i=i*3){
    statement # Some logic that the algorithm is performing.
}

A) O(Log(N) base3)
5)
# Multiple/Fractional loop algorithm
for (i = n; i < 1; i=i/5){
    statement # Some logic that the algorithm is performing.

A) O(Log(N) base5)

6)What is the time complexity of the following code snippet

void solve(int N, int M){

for(int i = 1 ; i <= N ; i++){

if(N % i == 0)

print(i);

for(int i = 1 ; i <= M ; i++){

if(M % i == 0)

print(i);

A) O(N+M)

A) O(1)
